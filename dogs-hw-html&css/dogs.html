            <p> The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The
                beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling). Possessing a great sense of
                smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as detection dogs for
                prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is
                intelligent. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
